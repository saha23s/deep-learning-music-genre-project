# Genre Classification

Team Members: Kexin and Sulagna

Abstract:

Our project proposes the implementation of a deep learning model for music genre classification. The task of music genre classification, as defined by Tzanetakis and Cook, aims to accurately predict the genre of a given piece of music. Such a task could enhance various music-related applications, including music recommendation systems and search engines, which rely on precise genre labeling.

Accurate genre classification could also assist in music analysis and understanding the characteristics of different music genres. The project might employ deep learning methods, which have shown promise in automatically learning features and patterns in audio data. These methods could potentially improve the accuracy of genre classification.

However, the specific deep learning techniques and architectures to be used will be determined as the project progresses, taking into consideration the latest advancements and best practices in the field.
